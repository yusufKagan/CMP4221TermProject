## Prerequisites

We strongly suggest that you use a virtual environment to work on. You need Gstreamer installed on your system before installing PyCairo and PyGObject libraries. They are getting built as they are installed. You also need to compile OpenCV from source with Gstreamer support.

## How To Use

Launch Server then Processor in separate processes. After that, you are free to launch as much clients as you want.
