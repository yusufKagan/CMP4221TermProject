## Prerequisites

We strongly suggest that you use a virtual environment to work on. You need Gstreamer installed on your system before installing PyCairo and PyGObject libraries. They are getting built as they are installed.

## How To Use

Launch Server then Processor in separate processes. After that, you are free to launch as many clients as you want. Default configuration is localhost for both sides.
